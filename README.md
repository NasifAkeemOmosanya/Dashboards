# Dashboards
This is a project that encompasses the implementation of different dashboard UI design from the simple to the complex. This is a rpository that is aimd at giving all levels of Front-End Engineers the inspiration to replicate the designs by getting their hands dirty while coding and learning in the process.
The goal is writing clean, scalable and well optimized code with high documentability references.
I would be using mostly web technologies in the projects for this repository. Such technologies which are not limited to the following:
- JavaScript.
- ReactJS.
- CSS3
- HTML5
- GraphQL
- Tailwind CSS
- SASS and LESS
- Chakra UI
  As well as many other technologies as they come.
  Lastly, beginners in the Web development space, can also use this as a learning curve to hone their skills.
  Thanks for reading.
  Now let us get our hands really busy, stay with me!
